# Unity Input Manager

A basic Input Manager in Unity using C#. There are definitely better ways of implementing this but this was just a little challenge to myself. The key rebinding system is best applied for games with a small number of inputs. 

By pressing escape the player can bring up a menu with the list of inputs. By clicking on a button, the program then waits for the player to assign a new key for that input.
